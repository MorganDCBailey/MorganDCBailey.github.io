										<h2><strong>Project Overview</strong></h2>
										As part of the Prototyping for Technical Designers module,
										a prototype of a game needed to be produced and meet the provided
										criteria. Following the option to either use a
										premade or custom project brief, a custom one was chosen for
										the freedom it would allow in the development process and the
										additional benefit of being able to create a prototype for a
										game that had already been conceptualised but never acted upon.
										<br>
										<br>
										The concept for the game came about after playing a game on itch.io called
										Paul's Cube Roll. While playing I wondered what a game like this crossed with
										a 3D platformer such as Super Mario Galaxy would look like, a cube and grid based
										game with the ability to go around the level. After making a brief visual
										mockup of the game within Unreal Engine the idea further intreagued me.
										<br>
										<br>
										Following the development of the project the resulting game became the video you can see bellow:

										<h2><strong>The Games Features</strong></h2>
										While the project in its current state is far from a fully fleshed out
										game and there are many areas that could easily be expanded upon,
										the game succeeded in being a prototype game suitable for the module.
										<br> <br>
										Some of the features currently present within the prototype include
										a timer, a moves counter, a simple game loop, basic VFX, a progress tracker,
										a basic puzzle mechanic, and a fully developed movement system that allows
										for full movement around the level.
										<br> <br>
										If I decide to continue the prototypes development into a fully functional game
										then some of the key areas that will be developed include the overall graphics,
										aditional audio, aditional levels, an expaned level system that would allow you
										to jump from one cube level to another (similar to Super Mario Galaxy), additional
										puzzles, a leaderboard system, additional settings, and many quality of life improvements.
